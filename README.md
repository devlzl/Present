# Present

## Introduction

![](./screenshot.png)
Present is a web-based presentation application.

[Try Present online](https://devlzl.github.io/Present/)

It's only been a month since the first line of code was written, and follow-up features are still being developed.

Through this project, I want to not only improve my technical skills, but also make a presentation application that works better than powerpoint online.
I implemented this project from scratch, and no functionality was done with third-party libraries.
Although the interface is built on Vue.js, the core logic and state management is almost framework-agnostic.
